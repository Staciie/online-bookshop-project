# BookPitch 
Online bookshop written with React (was created as a final project for the development course)

##### Link to see the demo: https://staciie.github.io/online-bookshop-project/
It isn't interactive and has less items displayed on main page (JSON server limits characters amount of db.json file)


##### To run the cloned project: 
* run `npm install`
* run `npm run server` to run local JSON server
* run `npm start` to open project inside browser (or go to `http://localhost:3000/` in any browser if it didn't open automatically)

###### Interface
